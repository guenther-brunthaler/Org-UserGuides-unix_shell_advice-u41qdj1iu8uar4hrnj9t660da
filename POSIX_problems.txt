_POSIX_FILESIZEBITS or pathconf(path, _PC_FILESIZEBITS):

POSIX states:

"Minimum number of bits needed to represent, as a signed integer value, the maximum size of a regular file allowed in the specified directory.

Minimum Acceptable Value: 32"

It is unclear whether it is meant "as a valid signed integer value" or rather "as an unsigned integer value after casting it into a signed integer value of the same magnitude".

In particular, on Linux, pathconf() returns 32 when FILESIZEBITS is queried for an MS-DOS FAT filesystem where the maximum file size is 2 ** 32 - 1 bytes.

This size cannot be expressed as a valid signed 32-bit integer value because such a value would need at least 33 bits.

However, it is quite possible to represent the value as an unsigned 32 bit integer value, cast it to a signed integer value, and back without information loss.

Linux therefore seems to interpret POSIX' wording the second way. However, it remains unclear what POSIX actually means.
